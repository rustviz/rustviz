//! Analysis for the “Needs-at” relations.
//!
//! In other words, finding expected vs existing permission for a path usage.
//!
//! # Walthrough
//!
//! The “boundaries” analysis is relatively simple and as such poses as a
//! good demonstration for how to use permissions in a larger analysis.
//!
//! This analysis must do three things:
//! 1. Find all places where a path is used at the source-level, determine what
//!    permissions are necessary for this operation to be allowed.
//! 2. Determine the MIR-level [`Place`] and [`Location`] for this usage.
//! 3. Compute the permissions the given Place actually has at the use point.
//!
//! These three steps are represented as two distinct stages. In the [`path_visitor`]
//! module all of the [`PathBoundary`]s are computed. This returns information
//! such as the expected permissions, and the [`HirId`] of the usage. There's some
//! other stuff available in the struct, mostly to resolve the Flow permissions, but
//! those aren't relevant for this basic discussion.
//!
//! ## Finding path usages
//!
//! ### Example
//!
//! Let's walk through what this would look like for a simple function:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! fn append_hello(s: &mut String) {
//!   println!("Adding hello to string { s }");
//!   s.push_str("hello!");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Within the function there are two path usages. The first within the `println!`
//! when `s` is read and the second when the method `push_str` is invoked on `s`.
//! Therefore, a call to [`get_path_boundaries`] should return a vector of two elements:
//!
//! ```text
//! [
//!   PathBoundary {
//!     hir_id: { &s }
//!     expected: Permissions { read: true, write: false, drop: false },
//!     ...
//!  },
//!  PathBoundary {
//!    hir_id: { &mut *s }
//!    expected: Permissions { read: true, write: true, drop: false },
//!    ...
//!  },
//! ]
//! ```
//!
//! Let's go through each of these boundaries and discuss what this information means and
//! how it was found. The first usage of `s` occurs within a macro. Macros, and other
//! desugarings, are in tension with how we want to display information. When traversing the
//! HIR, you won't see a nice source code location that looks like `println!("... {s}")`,
//! what you do see is an ugly monster, such as the following:
//!
//! ```text
//! ::std::io::_print(
//!     ::new_v1(
//!       &["... ", "\n"], &[::new_display(&s)]
//!     )
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! When desugaring, the compiler can insert new variables and places which are
//! _invisible_ at the source-level. The current solution to this is to use
//! [`rustc_hir::hir::Expr::is_syntactic_place_expr`] and [`rustc_span::Span::from_expansion`]
//! to find out if the path we're looking is a “syntactic place” (i.e., it looks like a place)
//! and if it came from some sort of expansion. Returning to our example, the HIR node that we
//! are going to find permissions for is `&s`. That is, the shared borrow that occurs within the macro
//! expansion. One last hiccup in the process of finding source spans is the span information
//! available in the HIR. For this macro, if you just look at the source location it will point
//! to somewhere from within rustc. We utilize the [`SpanExt::as_local`] method to sanitize spans
//! and lift them back to original source code.
//! Lastly, the struct [`ExpectedPermissions`] has a series of construction methods
//! which show concisely when certain permissions are expected for the respective uses.
//! In this case, a shared borrow only requires the Read permission.
//!
//! The second boundary returned corresponds to the usage of `s` as the receiver of the
//! invoked meethod `push_str`. At the HIR, this is desugared into a function call
//! passing the  receiver as the first argument, like so: `String::push_str(&mut *s, "hello!")`.
//! There isn't anything tricky about visualizing this information and the code is
//! straightforward, if you want to peruse through the HIR visitor [`path_visitor::HirExprScraper`].
//! The reason method calls are interesting is, at the time of writing, we visualize the
//! boundary stack in-between the receiver and the dot (`.`), instead of to the left of the
//! path like every other case. Note, there's also a reborrow introduced but that's only
//! relevant in the next section.
//!
//! ## Resolving actual permissions
//!
//! The second stage of the boundaries analysis is taking the found [`PathBoundaries`]
//! and converting them into a [`PermissionsBoundary`]. This is the step that does
//! most of the heavy lifting. So try to follow along!
//!
//! The crux of the entire analysis is converting a [`HirId`], specifially a HIR node
//! that we _know_ contains a path use, to the corresponding MIR [`Place`] and [`Location`].
//! Unfortunately, there isn't a “really good way” to do this and before we return to the
//! running example I'll outline the strategy that is currently taken.
//!
//! Given a `HirId`, we can use the [`IRMapper`] to gather all of the MIR instructions
//! that correspond to the given HIR node. That means, given a HIR node such as `let a = &b`,
//! the `IRMapper` can tell you that the below MIR instructions were generated:
//!
//! ```text
//! StorageLive(a);
//! _t0 = &b;
//! a = move _t0;
//! FakeRead(ForLet, a)
//! ```
//!
//! When doing resolution we search through the generated MIR instructions to find
//! all Places that belong to a source-visible path that belongs to a source-visible
//! variable. As you can see in the above mini-example, compiler temporaries are
//! introduced that we don't want to consider. After finding these so-called
//! “candidate places” we need to actually pick one that belongs to the _specific_ usage
//! we're interested in (more on this in the example). To date, every bug reported for
//! the boundaries analysis had to do with picking a place from the list of candidates.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! Returning to our example function, remember that we have two `PathBoundaries`,
//! representing `&s` and `&mut *s`.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! fn append_hello(s: &mut String) {
//!   println!("Adding hello to string { s }");
//!   s.push_str("hello!");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The first boundary is fortunately very simple. The MIR instructions generated for `&s` would
//! be something such as `_t0 = &s`. This means we have very little to search through, and the
//! list of candidate locations would be `[ s ]`. Thus we can easily resolve the place and location.
//!
//! _A quick side note_, in the above examples I've been using the source-level paths within
//! the MIR, but this **doesn't** happen. It's merely for readability. All paths are replaced
//! by compiler temporaries, and those coming from HIR paths will have extra debug information
//! attached to them. We can use the [`PlaceExt::is_source_visible`] method to see if a MIR
//! `Place` is something with that information attached. The attentive reader will note that
//! I've said “coming from the HIR” which means paths introduced by loop desugarings will
//! also have this attached debug info, this is only a minor inconvenience.
//!
//! The second boundary in our example is the `&mut *s` that occurs within the larger
//! method invocation. For this, the `IRMapper` will tell us that the following MIR
//! instructions are associated:
//!
//! ```text
//! let _t0 = &mut *s;
//! let _t1 = move _t0;
//! ...
//! String::push_str(move _t1, "hello!");
//! ```
//!
//! This demonstrates that there can be a level (or two, or three, ...) between
//! the action, in this case the method invocation, and the first _usage_ being
//! the reborrow. Method calls are quite straightforward because we can take
//! the first use of the path (and it's corresponding location), but for all
//! constructs that's not sufficient (e.g., array accesses first do a
//! bounds check, but the bounds check is on a different `Place` than what we're
//! after). One additional thing to note, however, is that for the method call our
//! resolved `Place` corresponds to `(*s)`, different from the path `s` visible
//! in the source code.
//!
//! For our example, after this selection we will have an exact `Place` and
//! `Location` for a path use. To get the actual permissions, we can use the
//! ever-so-handy [`PermissionsCtxt::permissions_data_at_point`] to get the
//! `PermissionsData`, a struct containing the exact permissions as well as
//! first-order provenance describing any active refinements.
//!
//! The entry location to this process of resolving a HIR path to a MIR place,
//! and retrieving the permissions can be found in the [`path_to_perm_boundary`] function.
