//! Internal state for managing permissions steps.
//!
//! The `SegmentedMir` aids the stepper in making sure that
//! steps made are always _valid_. In this context a step is defined
//! as a `MirSegment`, a simple struct that contains a `from` and `to`
//! location defining the step. The finished segmented mir is valid if
//! it satisfies the following criteria:
//!
//! 1. All segments are valid (more on this later).
//! 2. Segments form a total cover of the body under analysis.
//! 3. No location is included in multiple steps (see exceptions to this below).
//!
//! Segment validity is the main crux of the above definition and this is
//! split into three separate definitions. There exist three different kinds
//! of segments (spiritually, they are the same in the code):
//!
//! - Linear segments: a segment representing a linear piece of control flow.
//!   A linear segment has a single point of entry and a single exit. Formally,
//!   this is defined as:
//!       Given a `MirSegment { from, to }`, it is linear iff:
//!       `from` dominates `to` and `to` post-dominates `from`
//!   These segments are what we ultimately want.
//!
//! - Split segments: a segment representing the start of conditional control-flow.
//!   These segments relax the definition of a linear segment, in that the `to`
//!   location *does not* post-dominate `from`. These segments are important when
//!   representing control-flow given by a `switchInt`. In brief, a `switchInt`
//!   will have multiple jump targets based on its argument, and each one of these
//!   targets will be made into a split segment, stepping `from` the `switchInt`
//!   and stepping `to` the target location.
//!
//! - Join segments: a segment representing the close of conditional control-flow.
//!   These segments are the opposite of split segments, and relax the definition
//!   of a linear segment by lifting the requirement that `from` dominates `to`. After
//!   control-flow has been split (by say, a `switchInt`) join segments represent the
//!   steps needed to unify the control-flow again.
//!
//! Unless specified, the word "segment" or "step" always refers to a linear segment.
//! Whenever the stepper says "insert a step ending at location L", this will _always_
//! result in a linear step as the other two variants need to be explicitly handled.
//!
//! To maintain validity we use a recursive tree that incrementally builds up sequences
//! of linear steps. The tree layout looks (roughly) as follows:
//!
//! ```text
//! type LinearSegment = MirSegment
//! type SplitSegment  = MirSegment
//! type JoinSegment   = MirSegment
//!
//! data ControlFlow = Linear LinearSegment
//!                  | Branch
//!                      { splits :: [SplitSegment]
//!                      , joins  :: [JoinSegment]
//!                      , nested :: Collection
//!                      }
//!
//! data Collection = [ControlFlow]
//! ```
//!
//! To build this tree we manage a set of `CollectionBuilder`s, these
//! store the last `Location` from a step, and only allow inserting a
//! linear step into a collection. The exact process won't be outlined here,
//! but the stepper will open a branch when it encounters an `if` or `match`,
//! this opening will then create a new builder for each branch target. Builders
//! are then destroyed when either (1) it has reached a stopping point as
//! previously specified by the stepper, or (2) the branch that spawned the builder
//! is being closed.
//!
//! There is a little more to the process than this, for example: making sure that
//! branches and segments are created within the natural structure of the MIR and only
//! inserting steps in previously "unstepped" areas. But for those really curious
//! feel free to start at the [`SegmentedMirBuilder::insert`] function and explore
//! from there.
