//! Plugin regression tests against the corpus of `rustviz-plugin/tests/*.rs`.
//!
//! Each .rs file in the corpus is a Rust program the plugin should be able
//! to visualize. We don't pin exact SVG output (it's noisy and changes with
//! benign tweaks); instead we assert on three layers:
//!
//!   * `corpus_expected_ok_produce_well_formed_svg` — the regression floor.
//!     Every `EXPECTED_OK` snippet returns well-formed SVG (`<svg ...`) for
//!     both panels and the timeline carries at least one `tooltip-trigger`
//!     element (i.e. the plugin produced *some* annotations).
//!
//!   * `corpus_expected_tooltips_present` — the behaviour bar. For every
//!     entry in `EXPECTED_TOOLTIPS`, the listed `must_contain` strings must
//!     appear verbatim as `data-tooltip-text` values in the rendered
//!     timeline, and the `must_not_contain` strings must *not* appear.
//!     Containment semantics on both sides — extra tooltips are fine, only
//!     the listed ones are load-bearing.
//!
//!   * For features known to be unsupported (for-loops, conditional borrows,
//!     smart pointers, etc. — see README "Limitations") snippets stay off
//!     these lists; failures there aren't regressions until the feature is
//!     implemented.
//!
//! These tests use the `RV_RUNNER=local` backend, which requires
//! `cargo install --path rustviz-plugin --locked` to have been run first.
//! `setup.sh` does this for you. CI runs `setup.sh` before `cargo test`.
